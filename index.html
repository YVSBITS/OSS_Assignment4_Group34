<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This project is to identify the type of number i.e. prime, palindrome, fasinating, Armstrong etc.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-prime-number" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/YVSBITS/OSS_Assignment4_Group34/blob/main/README.md#prime-number"></a>Prime Number</h2>
<p>A number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). "prime numbers are very useful in cryptography".</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-palindrome-number" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/YVSBITS/OSS_Assignment4_Group34/blob/main/README.md#palindrome-number"></a>Palindrome Number</h2>
<p>A Palindrome no. is the number that remains the same when its digits get reversed. Ex: 15451, for example: If we take 131 and reverse it then after reversing the number remains the same. Input the number from the user.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-armstrong-number" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/YVSBITS/OSS_Assignment4_Group34/blob/main/README.md#armstrong-number"></a>Armstrong Number</h2>
<p>An Armstrong number is a positive m-digit number that is equal to the sum of the mth powers of their digits. It is also known as pluperfect, or Plus Perfect, or Narcissistic number.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-fasinating-number" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/YVSBITS/OSS_Assignment4_Group34/blob/main/README.md#fasinating-number"></a>Fasinating Number</h2>
<p>Multiplying a number by two and three separately, the number obtained by writing the results obtained with the given number will be called a fascinating number. If the result obtained after concatenation contains all digits from 1 to 9, exactly once.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-factorial-of-a-number" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/YVSBITS/OSS_Assignment4_Group34/blob/main/README.md#factorial-of-a-number"></a>Factorial of a Number</h2>
<p>The factorial of a number is the function that multiplies the number by every natural number below it. Symbolically, factorial can be represented as "!". So, n factorial is the product of the first n natural numbers and is represented as n!.</p>
