OSS Assignment 4 - Contributing to Open Source Software

## Project Description
This project is to identify the type of number i.e., odd, even, prime, palindrome, fasinating, Armstrong etc.

## Prime Number
A number that is divisible only by itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
"prime numbers are very useful in cryptography".

## Palindrome Number
A Palindrome no. is the number that remains the same when its digits get reversed. Ex: 15451, for example: If we take 131 and reverse it then after reversing the number remains the same. Input the number from the user.

## Armstrong Number
An Armstrong number is a positive m-digit number that is equal to the sum of the mth powers of their digits. It is also known as pluperfect, or Plus Perfect, or Narcissistic number.

## Fasinating Number
Multiplying a number by two and three separately, the number obtained by writing the results obtained with the given number will be called a fascinating number. If the result obtained after concatenation contains all digits from 1 to 9, exactly once.
